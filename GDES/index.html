      <p>Learning a language can be hard, especially if you're
        not going to be studying abroad anytime soon. Below
        is a list of recources that I have found that might be
        helpful in your studies. Click on the cat to navigate to
        a specific learning format, or just scroll on through.</p>
      <p>This list was also made to be as expansive as possible,
        so please fill out the recommendation form at the
        bottom so I can keep this list going.</p>

    <h1>Podcasts</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Podcasts can be one of the best ways to immerce yourself in Japanese. They also tend to have more content attached, so definately look into their social media, websites, and attached files for even more resources.</p>
    <div class="columns">
      <img src="images/Small Talk art.jpg" alt="Small Talk Podcast Art">
      <h2><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1tHH40EmOge2Ale4nlYWTq">Let's learn Japanese from small talk!</a></h2>
      <p>One of the beneficial aspects of this podcast are the vocabulary sheets provided with each episode. This way you can brush up on the vocab before listening to the conversations between our two hosts.</p>
      <p>Be sure to check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/smalltalkinjp?lang=en">@smalltalkinJP</a> Twitter account for some extra practice as well.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/48w03XsDsllY0I7wZYS6C1">Uncanny Japan</a></h2>
      <p>This is a little bit of a cheat for this list, but one aspect of learning a language is learning about the culture and this podcast is one of my personal favorites for that. Our host is Theresa Matsura who tells us about Japanese supersitions, legends, and other tales. I’ve been able to surprise some of my Japanese friends with the trivia I’ve learned from listening to this podcast.</p>

    <h1>YouTube Channels</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>There’s really good variety in Japanese-learning YouTube Channels ranging from vlogs to language teaching to culture studies. Here are a few to get you started.</p>
    <div class="columns">
      <img src="images/Japanese Ammo with Misa.jpg">
      <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBSyd8tXJoEJKIXfrwkPdbA">Japanese Ammo with Misa</a></h2>
      <p>Misa does a great job of mixing Japanese languge learning with learning about Japanese culture.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite videos is one where Misa talks about Valentine’s Day traditions in Japan while teaching you various ways to reject someone in Japanese.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <img src="images/Onomappu.jpg">
      <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLuymDHiOySsAQ9Nc-4NoEQ">Onumappu</a></h2>
      <p>This channel was created to help Japanese learners to understand Japanese onomatopoeia and become better at understanding “natural Japanese.”  Our host does a great job of blending real world application into his lessons and walking through everything step-by-step for optimal understanding. I would definately recommend his video on how to order pizza over the phone. It’s a lifesaver.</p>

  <div class="space-menu" id="anime">
    <h1>Anime</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Anime is the Japanese word for animation. Chances are if you are on this site you are well aquanted with the world of anime. Below I’ve compiled a list of beginner to intermediate level Japanese anime. If none of these suit you, I would recommend looking through Crunchyroll, Funimation, or VRV as they all offer free subbed anime (if you’re willing to watch ads) or you can search for anime on almost any streaming service.</p>
    <div class="columns">
      <img src="images/Usagi Drop.jpg">
      <h2><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/usagi-drop">Usagi Drop</a></h2>
      <p>This is one of the cutest anime I have ever seen. Detailing the relationship between a young girl that no one seems to want and the bachelor who decides to take her in, this anime is a wholesome and sweet ride utilizing a lot of basic, everyday Japanese.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <img src="images/violet evergarden.jpg">
      <h2><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80182123">Violet Evergarden</a></h2>
      <p>This anime follows Violet, a former military weapon, as she begins to find her purpose in life after the war.</p>
      <p>This anime is definately on the more difficult side in regards to Japanese language learning. However, it frequently repeats vocabulary which makes it easier for langage learners to catch on. It’s also not a slice of life or romantic drama which might be a nice change of pace for those tired of those genres in their Japanese studies.</p>

  <div class="space-menu" id="manga">
    <h1>Manga</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Manga (or Japanese comic books) can be a little difficult to find in their original Japanese. However, there are sites that have digital copies online, sites that allow you to switch between English and Japanese versions of manga at the click of a button, or you can find Japanese versions available for order on Amazon.</p>
    <div class="columns">
      <img src="images/Shirokuma Cafe.jpg">
      <h2><a href="https://bilingualmanga.com/manga/shirokuma-cafe">Shirokuma Cafe</a></h2>
      <p>This manga (and the anime of the same name) follows the adventures of a polar bear and his animal friends running a cafe. Yes. It is as quirky as it sounds.</p>
      <p>This manga is definatly tailored for those just beginning to learn Japanese as it uses relatively simple, everyday Japanese with enough humor and heart to keep you invested.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="columns">
      <img src="images/Yotsubato!.jpg">
      <h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yotsubato-Vol-Japanese/dp/4840224668">Yotsubato!</a></h2>
      <p>This slice of life manga about a young girl moving to a new town is one of the top manga recommentations for any Japanese beginner. We follow our young protagonist as she learns about life, so we can learn through her which makes it perfect for language learning. It also helps that most of the Japanese versions I have found put the furugana (aka the hiragana over kanji) to help you understand the story even if you do not know the kanji itself.</p>
