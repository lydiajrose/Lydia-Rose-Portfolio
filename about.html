    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>My name is Lydia Rose. I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities with a degree in Technical Writing and Communication and a minor in Japanese, however it’s a far cry from where I started.</p>
    <p>When I began college I was determined to become a computer scientist, but after a difficult first semester, I realized that I really didn't want coding to be my career. I had always been more interested in writing and I soon found myself inches away from becoming an English major when I discovered technical writing. </p>
    <p>While I didn’t want to be coding for the rest of my life, computer science and other scientific fields still intrigued me and technical writing was a perfect blend of my interests in writing and technology.</p>
    <p>During the course of my studies, I completed three separate internships where I utilized and developed these skills. First at the Mayo Clinic where I worked in their IT department deploying equipment for remote employees. Next at the Japan America Society of Minnesota (JASM) where I primarily wrote and solicited articles for their monthly newsletter and put  my Japanese minor to good use. Most recently I completed an internship with Best Buy as a member of their Training and Communications team where I wrote newsletter articles and job aids as well as conducting research for future projects.</p>
    <p>On this website you will find a wide selection of the work that I have done for these organizations and for my college classes.</p>
